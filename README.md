# Python_rEW-2DCOS
This file provides the core code of the rEW-2COS method. By integrating reflectance intensity data and spectral morphology data, the recognition ability of this method for sensitive bands is enhanced. Based on the 2DCOS equation, the autocorrelation peak is identified and further correlation elimination is carried out to obtain the sensitive band.
